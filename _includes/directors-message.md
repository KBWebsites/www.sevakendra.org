### Director's Message

As we have come to the end of the financial year we have every reason to thank God for all the manifold blessings He has bestowed upon the developmental activities carried out through Seva Kendra. I personally would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have helped our organization in one way or another in achieving our target.

I sincerely thank our Bishop Rt. Rev. Dr. George Pallipparambil, who is guiding, motivating and inspiring us. Also I would extend a word of gratitude to all the civil officers, local leaders and all the well-wishers.

Our charitable institution had set high goals, dreamt undreamed dreams, envisioned high ideals and to a great extent made it into realities for our people. We have extended our wings of service, empowered women, educated the young, alleviated the pain of the needy, brought solace and comfort to the sick, showed brighter light to the helpless.

We have reached out to a great number of villages and families in the five districts of East Arunachal Pradesh with women Empowerment programmes, community health programme, malaria eradication programme, Income Generation activities, upliftment of the differently abled children, livestock management programme like piggery, poultry etc. promotion of Kinder Garden through Cr√®che programme, Gender sensitization, awareness and animation programme for the School children. Seva Kendra has been Promoting Resource mobilization in the villages and Human rights Education in 10 schools in the diocese.

However, we cannot remain complacent. We have miles to go, different areas to cover, many more people to contact, villages to reach, problems to encounter, school drop outs to be helped out, new growing needs to be addressed. We are wingless without the contributing agencies and the staff who carry out the mission of our organization. I congratulate all my staff who contributed much for this success. A special word of thanks to Sr. Sunita Parmer, who has been spend her life and energy last five years for this organization and the people of this area. I wish her all the success in her studies. And also I like to welcome Sr. Pushpa, newly entering, and Mr. Bennison re-entering to the Seva Kendra family.

Once again I express my gratitude to each and every one and offer our prayers for all your endurance.

Sr. Rincy Kozhimala SH
